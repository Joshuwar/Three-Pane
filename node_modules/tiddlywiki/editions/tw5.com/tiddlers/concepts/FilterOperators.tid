The available filter operators are listed here. See TiddlerFilters for an introduction to tiddler filters and how they are used.

* ''title'': selects the tiddler with the title given in the operand
* ''is'': tests whether a tiddler is a member of the system defined set named in the operand (see below)
* ''has'': tests whether a tiddler has a non-empty value for the field specified in the operand
* ''sort'': sorts the tiddlers by the field specified in the operand
* ''sortcs'': a case sensitive sort of the current tiddlers by the field specified in the operand
* ''nsort'': sorts the tiddlers numerically by the field specified in the operand
* ''nsortcs'': a case sensitive (for the non-numerical elements) numerical sort of the current tiddlers by the field specified in the operand
* ''prefix'': tests whether a tiddlers title starts with the prefix specified in the operand
* ''limit'': limits the number of subresults to the integer specified in the operand
* ''tag'': tests whether a given tag is (`[tag[mytag]]`) or is not (`[!tag[mytag]]`) present on the tiddler
* ''field:{fieldname}'' or ''{fieldname}'': tests whether a tiddler field has a specified value (`[modifier[Jeremy]]` or `[field:modifier[Jeremy]]`) or not (`[!modifier[Jeremy]]`)
* ''tags'': selects the tags on the currently selected tiddlers
* ''tagging'': selects the tiddlers tagged with the currently selected tiddlers
* ''untagged'': selects the any of the selected tiddlers that do not have at least one tag
* ''links'': selects the outgoing links on the currently selected tiddlers
* ''backlinks'': selects the tiddlers that link to the currently selected tiddlers
* ''list'': selects the tiddlers listed in a specified [[TiddlerList|TiddlerLists]]
* ''next'': selects the next item in a TiddlerList after the current tiddler
* ''previous'': selects the previous item in a TiddlerList before the current tiddler
* ''listed'': selects the TiddlerLists that include the current tiddler
* ''each'': selects one tiddler for each discrete value of the specified field
* ''eachday'': selects one tiddler for each discrete day in the specified date field
* ''sameday'': selects all the tiddlers falling into the same day as the provided date in the specified date field
* ''fields'': returns the names of the fields present on the selected tiddlers
* ''search'': returns all tiddlers that contain the specified text
* ''reverse'': reverses the list
* ''first'': selects the first tiddler of the list (or the first n if the operand is n)
* ''last'': selects the last tiddler of the list (or the last n if the operand is n)
* ''rest'': selects all but the first tiddler of the list (or all but the first n if the operand is n)
* ''butfirst'': synonym for ''rest''
* ''bf'': another synonym for ''rest''
* ''butlast'': selects all but the last tiddler of the list (or all but the last n if the operand is n)
* ''bl'': another synonym for ''butlast''
* ''nth'': selects the n-th tiddler of the list. Defaults to n = 1
* ''indexes'': selects the names of the indexes within a [[DataTiddler|DataTiddlers]]

The operands available with the `is` operator are:

* ''tiddler'': selects all tiddlers excluding shadows, whether or not they are SystemTiddlers
* ''system'': selects all SystemTiddlers
* ''shadow'': selects all ShadowTiddlers
* ''current'': selects the CurrentTiddler
* ''missing'': selects all MissingTiddlers
* ''orphan'': selects all OrphanTiddlers
